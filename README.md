### 3. **Preview and Adjust**

- **Preview in Markdown Viewer**: Use the Markdown preview feature (`Ctrl+Shift+V` in VSCode) to check how the file looks. This helps identify any formatting issues or inconsistencies.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Check for consistent use of headings, bullet points, and tables. For example, always use `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections.

### 4. **Keep It Clean and Simple**

- **Avoid Excessive Decoration**: Keep the formatting clean and minimal. Avoid using too many different styles or decorations, as they can distract from the content.
- **Use Clear Language**: Be clear and concise. Avoid jargon or overly complex language.

### 5. **Check for Errors**

- **Spelling and Grammar**: Check for spelling and grammar mistakes.
- **Correct Links and Paths**: Ensure that all links, like badges or external links, are correct and working.

### 6. **Save and Commit**

Once you're satisfied with the README, save the changes and commit them to your repository.

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with usage and installation instructions"
git push origin main
